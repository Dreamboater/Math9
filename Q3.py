# 3) Modify the following code so that it outputs the correct values.
# The amount of gas left in a gas tank decreases as a car drives. An equation that models
# this scenario is y = -0.75x + 50, where y is the gas in litres and x is the number of
# kilometers driven.

x = int(input("Please enter the number of kilometers driven:"))

y = -0.07*x+50

print(f"The car has {y} litres left in the tank after driving {x} kilometers. ")

# Using the code above as a template complete the following word problem. Bonus points if you alter the
# code so that it only accepts a range of x values that make physical sense.

# A basket of apples is slowly being devoured by ants. If the basket has an initial value of 15 apples and the ants
# consume the apples at a rate of 0.5 apples per hour, create a program that outputs the number of apples remaining
# after x number of hours have pased.
